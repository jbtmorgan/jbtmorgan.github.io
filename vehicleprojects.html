  <h4>About The Golf:</h4>
  <p>This car was bought new at the dealership from Volkswagen in 1993 by my Grandfather. As of 2022, it requires intense bodywork
  to remove the rust, new paint, and general maintenance. </p>

  <h4>About The Project:</h4>
  <p>This project goes in tandem with the 1993 Volkswagen Golf. 
    The Golf has an older diesel-powered motor that is capable of running alternative fuels. 
    With the proper filtering procedures and patience, it is possible to run waste vegetable oil rather than diesel. 
    The hardware is prepared, currently, the limiting factor is sourcing the waste oil from restaurants. 
    This is a work in progress!
