  <h4>About the design:</h4>
  <p>This model was created for the purpose of replacing a family members ignition shroud as the original broke.
    The model was made in Fusion360 and then 3D printed.
    Additionally, I created a 2D drawing as an assignment for a design course.</p>

  <h4>About the design:</h4>
  <p>A common modification to make to a motorcycle is to buy an aftermarket tail kit to have brighter lights,
    as well as make the rear end look more aesthetically pleasing. To reduce costs, I made a concept sketch and
    3D printed a prototype of my custom tail kit. It held the lights license plate effectively and
    once I was satisfied with the fitment it was then made from metal to withstand the conditions.
    This project consisted of modelling, metal work, and electrical work.</p>

  <img src="assets/cad designs/keydrawing.PNG" alt="keyDrawing" width="593" height="417">
  <h4>About the design:</h4>
  <p>The ignition shroud was designed for two reasons. The first being, a family members original
    ignition shroud broke therefore a replacement was designed and printed. The second was because the
    drawing was an assignment in one of my courses.</p>
