  <h3>Components of Nissan 350z Adapter Kit</h3>

  <h4>About the design:</h4>
  <p>
    The photos provided show a transmission plate as well as a flywheel-crank-adapter for a Nissan 350z. 
    The end use of this kit is intended to connect a Nissan 350z Transmission to a Volkswagen Turbo Diesel Motor. 
    The first photo (transmission plate) contains the profile of the transmission, a hole for the starter motor, 
    and a method to connect to the Volkswagen side of the kit. 
    The second photo (crank-adapter) is the method of connecting a 350z flywheel to a Volkswagen motor.

  <h4>About the assembly:</h4>
  <p>
    At an internship, a task I was given was to build a master Solidworks assembly for the varying underdrives. 
    Each kit is similar, but can have a few differences in each setup. 
    In the end, there were approximlatey 10 different configurations each involving moving/meshing internal components.

  <h3>Key Ignition Shroud</h3>

  <img src="assets/cad designs/keydrawing.PNG" alt="keyDrawing" width="593" height="417">
  <h4>About the design:</h4>
  <p>This model was created for the purpose of replacing a family members ignition shroud as the original broke.
    The model was made in Fusion360 and then 3D printed.
    Additionally, I created a 2D drawing as an assignment for a design course.</p>

  <h3>Tail kit for Motorcycle</h3>
  <img src="assets/cad designs/stockTail.PNG" alt="stockTail" width="350" height="399">
  <img src="assets/cad designs/modelTail.PNG" alt="modelTail" width="367" height="417">
  <img src="assets/cad designs/frontTail.JPG" alt="frontTail" width="302" height="403">
  <img src="assets/cad designs/backTail.JPG" alt="backTail" width="302" height="403">
  <h4>About the design:</h4>
  <p>A common modification to make to a motorcycle is to buy an aftermarket tail kit to have brighter lights,
    as well as make the rear end look more aesthetically pleasing. To reduce costs, I made a concept sketch and
    3D printed a prototype of my custom tail kit. It held the lights license plate effectively and
    once I was satisfied with the fitment it was then made from metal to withstand the conditions.
    This project consisted of modelling, metal work, and electrical work.</p>

  <img src="assets/cad designs/keydrawing.PNG" alt="keyDrawing" width="593" height="417">
  <h4>About the design:</h4>
  <p>The ignition shroud was designed for two reasons. The first being, a family members original
    ignition shroud broke therefore a replacement was designed and printed. The second was because the
    drawing was an assignment in one of my courses.</p>
