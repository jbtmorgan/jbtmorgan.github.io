  <h4>About the design:</h4>
  <p>The ignition shroud was designed for two reasons. The first being, a family members original
     ignition shroud broke therefore a replacement was designed and printed. The second was because the
     drawing was an assignment in one of my courses.</p>

  <h4>About the design:</h4>
  <p>The original stock tailkit for my motorcycle was very bulky and needed some tweaking.
    I resolved this problem by making a 3D printed prototype and then once it fit the way I liked
    it, the model was made out of metal. A basic wiring harness was also made with the proper
    connectors to ensure the turn signals, brake light, and license plate light worked correctly.</p>
