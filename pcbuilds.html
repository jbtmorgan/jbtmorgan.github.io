  <h2>Jayden Morgan's Project Portfolio - PC Builds</h2>
  <hr/>
  <p>I have assembled countless number of computer systems throughout the years. The systems I have
    selected are my favourites, in no particular order. </p>
  <br>

  <h3>My Personal System</h3>

  <h4>Specifcations:</h4>
  <p>CPU: Ryzen 7 1700</p>
  <p>GPU: NVIDIA GTX 1080</p>
  <p>RAM: 16GB</p>
  <h4>About the tower:</h4>
  <p>This tower means a lot to me. I have built it from the ground up using some used components,
     some new, and made some minor modifications to it. My tower will continue to grow along with my
     passion for computer hardware.</p>

  <h3>$4,000 Video Editing & Gaming System</h3>
  <h4></h4>

  <h4>Specifcations:</h4>
  <p>CPU: Ryzen 9 3900x</p>
  <p>GPU: NVIDIA RTX 2080 Super</p>
  <p>RAM: 32GB</p>
  <h4>About the tower:</h4>
  <p>While browsing Facebook one day, an indivudal posted asking for assistance in building a desktop
  for video editing and gaming. I created a list of components in their price range and assembled it.
  It was a fun project overall!</p>
  <br>

  <h3>"Big Blue"</h3>
  <img src="assets/pc builds/bigblue.jpg" alt="bigblue" width="403" height="302">
  <h4>Specifcations:</h4>
  <p>CPU: Intel i5 3570k</p>
  <p>GPU: NVIDIA GTX 970</p>
  <p>RAM: 24GB</p>
  <h4>About the tower:</h4>
  <p>This towers internals used to be in an older, scratched case but was then transferred into
  this nicer tempered glass chasis. It was a powerful machine for the average user and was later
  purchased for gaming by an indivudal.</p>
