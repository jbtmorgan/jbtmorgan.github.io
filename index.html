    <h2>Jayden Morgan's Project Portfolio</h2>

  <hr/>
  <h4>About Me:</h4>
  <p>I am a curious and hands on student that is currently enrolled in my second year of Engineering.
    In my free time, I work on various projects that includes but not limited to working with computers,
    servers, and creating Computer-Aided-Designs. My interest in video games allowed me to explore the realm of custom
    computer building. From that point, it caused my interests to spiral into many different categories.</p>
  <h4>Purpose of my Portfolio:</h4>
  <p>Currently I have no way of showcasing all my big projects I have tackled throughout the years.
    I created this page to experiment with HTML, along with having a simple yet detailed space to
    show off my projects.

          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p1>I am a curious and hands on student that is currently enrolled in second year of Engineering.
            In my free time, I work on various projects that involve working with computers, vehicles
            , and 3D modelling. My interest in video games allowed me to explore the realm of custom
            computer building. From that point, it caused my interests to spiral into many different categories related to
            science, technology, and automotives.</p1>
          <h1>Purpose of the Portfolio</h1>
          <p1>I wanted to make a website portfolio for two reasons. The first objective was to have a place to showcase
          some of my favourite projects I have made over the years. The second was to experiment with basic HTML coding. Everything
        on this page has been written in a basic text editor and is still in progress! </p1>
