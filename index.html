  <h2>Jayden Morgan's Project Portfolio</h2>

  <h4>About Me:</h4>
  <p>I am a curious and hands on student that is currently enrolled in my second year of Engineering.
    In my free time, I work on various projects that includes but not limited to working with computers,
    servers, and creating Computer-Aided-Designs. My interest in video games allowed me to explore the realm of custom
    computer building. From that point, it caused my interests to spiral into many different categories.</p>
  <h4>Purpose of my Portfolio:</h4>
  <p>Currently I have no way of showcasing all my big projects I have tackled throughout the years.
    I created this page to experiment with HTML, along with having a simple yet detailed space to
    show off my projects.
