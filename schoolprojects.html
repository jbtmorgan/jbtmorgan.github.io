  <h3>Rolling Ball Structure</h3>

  <p>In ENGR121, I worked in a team of 3 people to design, test, and build a rolling ball structure.
    My contribution was to deliver an electrically controlled speaker, gate-system,
    and an elevator that raised a 1" steel ball one meter high.
    It involved mechanical, electrical, and software aspects of engineering.
    This was built when school was fully online,
    and it was an excellent learning experience working in a team online.</p>

  <h3>3D Printed Bridge</h3>

  </video>
  <p>In ENGR112, each student proposed a design for a bridge challenge.
    I am fortunate enough that I was able to test my design as I have my own a 3D printer.
    I utilized Fusion360 and experimented with the structural analysis part of the program.
    The bridge held a substantial amount of weight as shown.</p>

  <h3>Highschool VR Setup(s)</h3>
  <h4>VR Setup #1:</h4>
  <img src="assets\vr setups\lssvr.PNG" alt="lssvr" width="338" height="177">
  <p>During grade 10, my information technologies teacher proposed the idea of introducing
  a virtual-reality headset into the classroom to enhance learning with 3D modelling and game development.
  It was an enterainting project as I had to build a three custom PCs along with setting up two optimized VR setups.</p>
  <br>
  <h4>VR Setup #2:</h4>
  <img src="assets\vr setups\cedarvr.JPG" alt="cedarvr" width="302" height="403">
  <p>The second VR setup was at my next school. I proposed the idea to the principal and setup a virtual-reality
  and 3D printing room dedicated for students interested in technology. Again, I budgeted the parts and assembled
  a custom computer for the application of 3D modelling and VR.</p>
