  <h2>Jayden Morgan's Project Portfolio - School Projects</h2>
  <hr/>
  <p>Throughout highschool and university, I have tackled many different projects consisting of vastly different difficulties. </p>
  <br>

  <h3>Rolling Ball Structure</h3>

  <video width="216" height="410" controls>
    <source src="assets\rolling ball structure\handBrakeStruc.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
  <p>In ENGR121, I was required to work in a team of 3 people to design, test, and build a rolling ball structure.
    My contribution was to deliver an electrically controlled speaker, gate-system, and an elevator that raised
    a 1" steel ball one meter high. The most difficult part of it was finding the time to construct it while still
    doing well in my other courses.</p>
  <br>

  <h3>3D Printed Bridge</h3>

  <video width="426" height="240" controls>
    <source src="assets\bridge project\demoBridge.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
  <p>In ENGR112, each student proposed a design for a bridge challenge. I am fortunate enough that I was able to interest
  to test my design as I own a 3D printer already. It was a fun project as I shared the provided video with my classmates
  demonstrating that my proposed design could hold a substantial amount of weight.</p>
  <br>


  <h3>Highschool VR Setup(s)</h3>
  <h4>VR Setup #1:</h4>
  <img src="assets\vr setups\lssvr.PNG" alt="lssvr" width="338" height="177">
  <p>During grade 10, my information technologies teacher proposed the idea of introducing
  a virtual-reality headset into the classroom to enhance learning with 3D modelling and game development.
  It was an enterainting project as I had to build a three custom PCs along with setting up two optimized VR setups.</p>
  <br>
  <h4>VR Setup #2:</h4>
  <h2>*Picture coming soon*</h2>
  <p>The second VR setup was at my next school. I proposed the idea to the principal and setup a virtual-reality
  and 3D printing room dedicated for students interested in technology. Again, I budgeted the parts and assembled
  a custom computer for the application of 3D modelling and VR.</p>
